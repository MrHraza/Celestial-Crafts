## Developer

<br>

As a Developer I want to push myself and demonstrate my ability with different coding languages in combination.

<br>

## Design choices

<br>

#### Colours

In this project the color palette consists of black, white, light brown, and dark brown. This in my opinion was a strong and thoughtful choice for the following reasons; 

- **Warm and Earthly tones**: Light brown and dark brown evoke a sense of warmth, comfort, and nature. These colors are associated with organic materials like wood, leather, and earth, which align perfectly with a crafts website that focuses on handmade, artisanal products.

- **Proffessional and Timless contrast**: The Black and White combination ensures that the website looks polished and organized, which is important for user experience and readability.

- **Emotional and Psychological Impact**: Dark brown is often associated with reliability, stability, and support, which are great qualities to convey in a business centered on handmade products. It can give customers the impression that your products are made with care and attention to detail.


<br>

#### Typography

I used one font throughout for its populatrity in webdesign, 'Lato'.

**Lato:**

- The font's design strikes a balance between being friendly and approachable while maintaining a professional tone.
- I found that it has been designed with excellent readability in mind, both at small and large sizes. Its clean lines and balanced proportions ensure that text remains legible across different devices and screen resolutions. 
- The fontâ€™s letter spacing and weight distribution make it easy on the eyes, which enhances the user experience.
- Lato was designed specifically for the web, so it renders well across different browsers and operating systems.

<br>

#### Imagery

Seven images in total, a background on the homepage and six products displayed on the products page can be seen on the website.

<br>

#### Site Structure

I have opted for a multi-page website as this offers flexibility, organization, and scalability.

<br>

## Version Control

<br>

Version control for this project was managed using Git and GitHub. Git was used via the terminal in gitpod.io to commit changes.

#### Commit Habits

Commits were made throughout the development process to ensure that changes were tracked effectively. This approach not only provided a clear history of the project's progression, but also ensured that any changes could be rolled back if necessary.

#### GitHub 

GitHub was used as the remote repository for storing the project's code and resources. It provided a backup of the project and allowed it to be accessed from different locations.

#### Contributors

I am the sole developer of this project.

## Defects list

<br>

*On smaller screens the layout could do with some more organising, for a more user friendly experience.
*Also the accordian on the homepage, on smaller screens could be better.
